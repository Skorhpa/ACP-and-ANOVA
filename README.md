# ACP-and-ANOVA
A small project to introduce the notions of data cleaning and multivariate analysis.

This was my first real project introducing these concepts.

I had played around a little bit with machine learning before that using Fisher's Iris dataset, but the concepts at the time were more ambiguous.
